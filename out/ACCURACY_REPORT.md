# Dota 2 Match Prediction Accuracy Analysis - Complete Report

**Analysis Date**: 2025-10-07  
**Total Matches Analyzed**: 105,928  
**Data Source**: matches_detailed.csv  

## Executive Summary

This analysis evaluated prediction accuracy across multiple conditions and their combinations using role-based hero statistics. The key finding is that **Delta (Win Rate + Advantage) remains the strongest single predictor**, with accuracy reaching **56.14% at threshold 30**. Combinations of conditions do not significantly improve accuracy beyond using Delta alone.

---

## Methodology

### Role Assignment
- Heroes assigned to 5 roles: Carry, Mid, Offlane, Soft Support, Hard Support
- Assignment based on D2PT (DotaBuff Pro Tracker) rating for each role
- Each team guaranteed to have exactly 1 hero per role
- Greedy algorithm: assign heroes to their best role by D2PT rating

### Prediction Method
1. Calculate team scores using role-specific statistics
2. Compute deltas between radiant and dire teams
3. Apply threshold: if |delta| >= threshold, make prediction
4. Prediction direction: team with positive delta wins

### Conditions Tested
1. **Delta**: Win Rate + Hero Advantage sum
2. **KDA**: Kill/Death/Assist ratio
3. **D2PT**: DotaBuff Pro Tracker rating
4. **NW10**: Net Worth at 10 minutes
5. **NW20**: Net Worth at 20 minutes
6. **LaneAdv**: Lane advantage value

| 12 | Delta>=15 AND NW20>=1500 | 18,557 | 53.59% | Lower threshold |
| 13 | Delta>=20 OR LaneAdv>=10 | 46,804 | 52.79% | OR reduces accuracy |
| 14 | Delta>=20 OR LaneAdv>=12 OR NW20>=2500 | 59,475 | 52.40% | Multiple OR worse |
| 15 | Delta>=35 OR LaneAdv>=15 | 20,017 | 51.71% | OR significantly worse |

### Key Findings from Combinations

1. **No improvement from combinations**: Adding conditions with AND reduces both accuracy and coverage
2. **OR operations decrease accuracy**: Combining with OR significantly reduces prediction quality
3. **Delta alone is optimal**: Single Delta condition outperforms all tested combinations
4. **Simple is better**: Complex multi-condition rules do not improve predictions

---

## Recommendations

### For Maximum Accuracy
Use **Delta >= 30** for predictions:
- **Accuracy**: 56.14%
- **Coverage**: 5,424 games (5.1% of matches)
- **Use case**: When you need high confidence predictions

### For Balanced Approach  
Use **Delta >= 20** for predictions:
- **Accuracy**: 55.08%
- **Coverage**: 19,141 games (18.1% of matches)
- **Use case**: Good balance of accuracy and coverage

### For Maximum Coverage
Use **Delta >= 10** for predictions:
- **Accuracy**: 53.59%
- **Coverage**: 52,765 games (49.8% of matches)
- **Use case**: When you need to make predictions on most matches

## Statistical Analysis

### Coverage vs Accuracy Trade-off

| Threshold | Games | Coverage | Accuracy | Gain over Random |
|-----------|-------|----------|----------|------------------|
| Delta>=5  | 77,878 | 73.5% | 52.79% | +2.79% |
| Delta>=10 | 52,765 | 49.8% | 53.59% | +3.59% |
| Delta>=15 | 32,950 | 31.1% | 54.14% | +4.14% |
| Delta>=20 | 19,141 | 18.1% | 55.08% | +5.08% |
| Delta>=25 | 10,510 | 9.9% | 55.98% | +5.98% |
| Delta>=30 | 5,424 | 5.1% | 56.14% | +6.14% |

### Why Other Conditions Fail

1. **KDA**: Measured post-game, may not reflect hero matchup advantages
2. **D2PT**: Player skill rating doesn't translate to hero matchup predictions
3. **NW10/NW20**: Economic stats don't capture hero synergy/counter relationships
4. **LaneAdv**: Lane phase advantage is only one aspect of the full game

## Conclusions

1. **Delta is the dominant predictor**: 56.14% accuracy at optimal threshold
2. **Role-based stats don't add value**: KDA, D2PT, NW, LaneAdv show minimal predictive power
3. **Combinations don't help**: Adding conditions decreases both accuracy and coverage
4. **Optimal strategy**: Use Delta >= 20-30 depending on desired accuracy/coverage balance
5. **Maximum achievable**: ~56% accuracy represents fundamental predictability limit with current features

### Why ~56% is the Ceiling

The ~56% accuracy ceiling suggests:
- Hero matchups explain ~6% of game outcomes
- Player skill, execution, strategy account for the remaining 44%
- Current statistical model captures hero matchup effects well
- Further improvement requires game-specific features (patch, player skill, draft order, etc.)

---

## Future Research Directions

To potentially improve predictions beyond 56%, consider:

1. **Player-specific data**: MMR, recent performance, hero proficiency
2. **Draft order**: First pick vs last pick advantages
3. **Patch version**: Meta shifts between patches
4. **Team synergies**: Hero combinations beyond pairwise matchups
5. **Game mode**: Ranked vs casual, region-specific trends
6. **Time of day**: Player performance variations
7. **Recent meta**: Weight recent matches more heavily
