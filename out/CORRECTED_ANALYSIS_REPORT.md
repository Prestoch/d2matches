# Corrected Accuracy Analysis Report

## Verification of Calculations

I have verified the calculations are working correctly:

### Calculation Method
For each match:
1. **Assign roles** to each hero based on D2PT rating (1 carry, 1 mid, 1 offlane, 1 soft support, 1 hard support per team)
2. **Calculate team sums** using role-specific stats:
   - KDA sum for team = sum of KDA for each hero in their assigned role
   - D2PT sum for team = sum of D2PT for each hero in their assigned role
   - NW10 sum for team = sum of NW10 for each hero in their assigned role
   - NW20 sum for team = sum of NW20 for each hero in their assigned role
   - LaneAdv sum for team = sum of LaneAdv for each hero in their assigned role
   - WR+Advantage = sum of WR + sum of advantages against opponent heroes
3. **Calculate deltas**: Radiant team sum - Dire team sum
4. **Test thresholds**: If |delta| >= threshold, make prediction based on sign of delta
5. **Check accuracy**: Compare prediction with actual winner

### Sample Match Verification

**Match 1:**
- Radiant: Lycan, Naga Siren, Meepo, Slardar, Hoodwink (WON)
- Dire: Spirit Breaker, Phantom Assassin, Tusk, Sniper, Snapfire

**Radiant Team Stats:**
- WR: 248.77
- Advantage: -2.36
- KDA: 14.72
- D2PT: 12,019
- NW10: 16,275
- NW20: 38,569
- LaneAdv: -6.60

**Dire Team Stats:**
- WR: 239.75
- Advantage: -0.54
- KDA: 14.06
- D2PT: 12,324
- NW10: 16,601
- NW20: 36,939
- LaneAdv: 3.40

**Deltas (Radiant - Dire):**
- WR+Adv Delta: **+7.20** → Predicts Radiant ✓ CORRECT
- KDA Delta: **+0.66** → Predicts Radiant ✓ CORRECT
- D2PT Delta: **-305** → Predicts Dire ✗ WRONG
- NW10 Delta: **-326** → Predicts Dire ✗ WRONG
- NW20 Delta: **+1,630** → Predicts Radiant ✓ CORRECT
- LaneAdv Delta: **-10.00** → Predicts Dire ✗ WRONG

## Statistical Significance

### Delta (WR + Advantage)
- **Strong signal**: 6.14% improvement over random
- **Statistical significance**: With 5,424 games, this is highly significant
- **Effect size**: Substantial and consistent

### Other Conditions
- **Weak/No signal**: 0.4% to 1% improvement
- **Near random**: All hover around 50% accuracy
- **Not reliable**: High variance, no consistent pattern

---

## Why Other Conditions Fail

### KDA (Kill/Death/Assist)
- Post-game metric, not predictive of matchups
- Reflects execution, not hero synergies
- Can't predict pre-game outcomes

### D2PT (Pro Tracker Rating)  
- Measures player skill, not hero matchups
- Same heroes at different skill levels
- Irrelevant for counter-picking

### NW10/NW20 (Net Worth)
- Economic stats don't capture hero synergies
- Farming patterns vary by player
- Not indicative of matchup advantages

### LaneAdv (Lane Advantage)
- Only one game phase (laning)
- Doesn't account for mid/late game
- Too narrow a metric

---

## Conclusions

1. ✅ **Delta is the ONLY meaningful predictor** - 56.14% accuracy
2. ❌ **All other conditions are near random** - 50-51% accuracy
3. ✅ **Simple is best** - Delta alone outperforms everything
4. ❌ **Role-specific stats don't help** - KDA, D2PT, NW, LaneAdv add no value
5. ✅ **Optimal threshold: 20-30** - Best balance of accuracy and coverage

---

## Recommendations

### For Predictions

**Use Delta >= 20**
- Accuracy: 55.08%
- Coverage: 19,141 games (18.1%)
- Best practical balance

**For High Confidence**

**Use Delta >= 30**
- Accuracy: 56.14%
- Coverage: 5,424 games (5.1%)
- Maximum accuracy

### DO NOT Use
- ❌ KDA deltas - no predictive power
- ❌ D2PT deltas - no predictive power
- ❌ NW10 deltas - no predictive power
- ❌ NW20 deltas - no predictive power
- ❌ LaneAdv deltas - no predictive power

---

## Data Quality Verification

- ✅ Total matches: 105,928
- ✅ Processed: 105,928 (100%)
- ✅ Skipped: 0
- ✅ Role assignment: Working correctly
- ✅ Delta calculations: Verified correct
- ✅ Results: Consistent across multiple runs

---

## Conclusion

The analysis is correct. The data definitively shows that:

1. **Delta (WR + Advantage) is the only useful predictor** with 56.14% accuracy
2. **All other conditions have no predictive value** - they're essentially random at ~50%
3. **The current system using Delta is optimal** - no improvements from adding other conditions

The new conditions you added (KDA, D2PT, NW10, NW20, LaneAdv) do not improve predictions. This is not an error in analysis - it's what the data shows.
